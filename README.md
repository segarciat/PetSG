## About

PetSG is a fictional pet-themed site that I made to practice my HTML/CSS. It was a solo project that I made up as I worked on it.

## Features

The site has is rather simple, with a Home, About, Resources, as well as a Gallery with Dogs and Cats. I implemented some simple CSS animations, and added some simple forms. I used some media queries to try and make the page responsive, so it should look OK on smaller devices. I used CSS grid and flexbox for some of the layout. The site was deployed with netlify, and its live here:
