# PetSG

PetSG is a mock pet-themed site, and it is live at https://petsg.xyz

## Description

PetSG is the first website I ever made. I kept it simple by using just HTML and CSS (well, SASS). I got the idea from the fact that, at the time, I had just recently adopted my cat Peggy.

## Authors and Acknowledgement

- Sergio Garcia (myself).
- I got all the images from https://www.pexels.com/, and tried to list the owners in `acknowledgement.md`.

## Project Status

Though I declared this project as finished around a year and a half ago, I have been thinking of going back to refactor the website. Among the ideas in mind are:

- Rebuilding the application to use REACT.
- Using the [PetFinder API](https://www.petfinder.com/developers/v2/docs/).
